# Firestone Idle Bot

A bot to play the idle RPG "Firestone" for you while you're AFK. This is very much a WIP and I'm fully aware that this repo is currently a very large mess. I'll be updating it and keeping it maintained better as I move forward.

## Getting Started

This app is written in Python 3.

### Dependencies

Here are the modules you'll need to install to work with this script.

```
pyautogui
pytesseract
tesseract-ocr https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
```

## Versioning

We use a simple date based system - BROKEN.FEATURE.FIX.REVISION
