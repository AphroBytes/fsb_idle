# Firestone Idle Bot

A bot to play the idle RPG "Firestone" for you while you're AFK. This is very much a WIP and I'm fully aware that this repo is currently a very large mess. I'll be updating it and keeping it maintained better as I move forward.

## Getting Started

### Python 3
This app is written in Python 3. As such, you'll need to install [32-bit Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.1/python-3.8.1.exe) on your system.

### Tesseract OCR
Key features in this bot require the use of Google's Tesseract so that it can "read" what's on the screen. The latest build can be downloaded [HERE](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). NOTE: Please install the `32-bit` version!

### Prerequisites

Here are the modules you'll need to install to work with this script.

```
pyautogui
pytesseract
opencv-python
tesseract-ocr
```
If you use one of the compiled installers under `Releases`, these modules will be installed for you automatically - if you don't already have them.

## Versioning
