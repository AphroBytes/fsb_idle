# Firestone Idle Bot 

## Website
For more information regarding this project you can visit https://firestone.div0ky.com

## Summary
A bot to play the idle RPG "Firestone" for you while you're AFK. This is very much a WIP and I'm fully aware that this repo is currently a very large mess. I'll be updating it and keeping it maintained better as I move forward.

## Getting Started

### Python 3
This app is written in Python 3.

### Prerequisites

#### Tesseract OCR
Key features in this bot require the use of Google's Tesseract so that it can "read" what's on the screen. The latest build can be downloaded [HERE](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). NOTE: Please install the `32-bit` version!

## Versioning
We are attempting to use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

Check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/div0ky/fsb_idle/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.

## Launching the bot
Read the [documentation](https://firestone.div0ky.com/docs) for more inforation. 

NOTE: The bot assumes you used the provided installer. If you did not, you're likely to run into several critical errors that make the bot unusable. Please use a provided binary.
